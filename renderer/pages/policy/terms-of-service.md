# **Terms of Service**

Effective: Sep 24, 2023

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access to and use of the Services made available by Vento Tech LLC. By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you use our Services on behalf of an entity or organization, you are binding that organization to these Terms, and you represent that you have the authority to do so.

## **1. Vento’s Services**

**1.1 Registration.** Vento provides video recording services for personal and work use. Upon registration, a user must either create a new Workspace or join an existing Workspace. If a user creates a new Workspace on behalf of themselves, the user is the Customer. If a user creates a new Workspace on behalf of an organization (such as the user’s employer), the organization is the Customer. Customers can invite Authorized Users to their Workspace and must designate at least one Authorized User to be an Administrator, who will manage and control the Workspace. If a user joins an existing Workspace created by another person or organization, that person or organization is the Customer and the user is an Authorized User. All Customers, Administrators, and Authorized Users must comply with these Terms.

**1.2 Access.** During the Subscription Term, Customer may access and use, and may allow Authorized Users to access and use the Services for its business purposes in accordance with these Terms.

**1.3 Software.** Vento may make Software available as part of the Services. Subject to these Terms, Vento grants to Customer and its Authorized Users a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to download and use the Software to the extent necessary to use the Services. Software may update automatically. To the extent a component of the Software contains any open source software, the open source license for that software will govern with respect to that component.

**1.4 Restrictions.** Customer will not and will ensure Authorized Users do not: (a) reproduce, modify, adapt, or create derivative works of the Services; (b) rent, lease, distribute, sell, transfer, or sublicense the Services to a third party except as permitted in these Terms; (c) interfere with, disrupt, or circumvent any security measures or mechanisms designed to protect the Services; (d) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs of Services; (e) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Services; (f) harass, threaten, spam or cause distress, unwanted attention, or discomfort to a person or entity; (g) impersonate or falsely state or misrepresent an affiliation with anyone; (h) use the Services to transmit any viruses, worms, trojan horses, or other harmful or malicious code or programs; (i) use the Services to build competitive products; or (j) misuse the Services in any way, including in violation of these Terms or applicable law.

Customer will prevent, terminate, and notify Vento of any unauthorized or illegal use of or access to its or any Authorized User account or the Services.

**1.5 Corporate Domains.** If a user creates a Workspace using an email address belonging to their employer or organization, that account may be added to the organization's Workspace, in which case Vento will provide notice to the user or Administrator of the account, so they can help facilitate the transfer of their account. The Administrator of the Workspace will have the ability to control that account, which includes being able to access, modify, or remove information from the account, modify user roles, and delete or restrict access to the account. Customers and Authorized Users agree to comply with their organization’s terms and policies regarding use of the Service.
