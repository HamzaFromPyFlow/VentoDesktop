# **Copyright Policy**

The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") provides recourse to copyright owners who believe that their rights under the United States Copyright Act have been infringed by acts of third parties over the Internet.


In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, we have adopted a policy of removing copyrighted content when we receive a valid removal request and terminating, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe upon the copyrights of others. We also reserve the right to limit access to our service or terminate the account of any user who infringes any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there has been any repeat infringement.


If you believe that any content uploaded or made available on our platform infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, you may notify us in accordance with the DMCA process below.

# **Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement**

Vento takes claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law. If you believe any content on our platform infringes your copyright, you may request removal of the content (or access to it) from our platform by submitting written notification to our designated DMCA agent below.

In accordance with the DMCA, the written notice must include substantially the following:


Your physical or electronic signature.


Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if multiple works are involved, a representative list of such works.


Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material.


Adequate information by which we can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, email address).


A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.


A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate.
A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.


You may submit your notice to copyright@vento.com

If you fail to comply with all of the requirements above, your DMCA notice may not be effective.
Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

# **Counter-Notification Procedures**

If you believe that material you posted on platform was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification with us by submitting a email notification above.

 Pursuant to the DMCA, the counter-notice must include substantially the following:

- Your physical or electronic signature.


- An identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location where the material appeared before it was removed or access disabled.


- Adequate information by which we can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, email address).


- A statement under penalty of perjury by you that you have a good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification.


- A statement that you will consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or if you reside outside the United States for any judicial district in which vento may be found) and that you will accept service from the person (or an agent of that person) who provided us with the complaint at issue.


The DMCA allows us to restore the removed content if the party filing the original DMCA notice does not file a court action against you within ten business days of receiving the copy of your counter-notice.


Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

# **Repeat Infringers**

It is our policy in appropriate circumstances to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe the copyrights of others.
