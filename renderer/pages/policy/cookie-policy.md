# **Cookie Policy**
This Cookie Policy describes the types of cookies and similar technologies that Vento uses, how we use them, and your options for managing cookies.

**What is a Cookie?**

A cookie is a small piece of information that is downloaded to your computer or mobile device to enable certain features and functionality. Cookies are intended to help you access and use websites and applications faster and more efficiently and to provide a more personalized experience. For example, cookies can help you enter a site without having to login, resume where you left off, remember your preferences, and track and analyze how you use a site so the site can be improved. The cookies we use may be associated with Vento’s domain (first-party cookies) or a third party’s domain (third-party cookies).

**How We Use Cookies**

We use cookies and other similar technologies such as pixels, beacons and tags for the purposes described below. The cookies we use can be categorized into four categories: essential, marketing, personalization, and analytics. Some essential cookies that we use are “session cookies,” meaning that even though they have a defined lifespan, they are refreshed each time you visit our website or application.

We use Google Analytics to measure aggregate website statistics on our website to track performance over time.
